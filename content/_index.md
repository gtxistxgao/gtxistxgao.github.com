An unknown engineer from Blind:

> Build applications end to end on multiple platforms and in multiple languages. Develop the desire to learn how to build everything single handedly. Do not be constrained by the herd mindset of being server side or client side or windows or Linux Dev. Do it all.  Do not use boxed high level tech stacks that will change every few years. Learn the open standards and understand the underlying principles. Example understand how web sockets work instead of just relying on SignalR library. Host your own tcp endpoint and build your own simple http server than merely use IIS. You will soon learn that everything is very logical and simpler than what it seemed.  Once you understand the fundamentals, you will be able to learn the future enhancements without even looking at the code. Building end to end projects will give you the depth and breadth and will force you to think in ways you did not have to while working at Microsoft. Also you will be able to abstract patterns, recognize common problems and  build better frameworks yourself. That is how KnockoutJS, ReactJs came into existence. Do not aspire to be a learner of frameworks and technologies. Aspire to be the person who build the next framework or technology. If you have the desire and out in the hours, things will happen.
